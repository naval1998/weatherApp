                            methodology for grading machine-harvested tea leaves, overseeing the project with a focus on
                            maintaining tactical control over budgets and timelines. Utilizing an Industrial Internet of
                            Things (IIoT)-based control system, the project incorporated programmable logic controllers

                            quality standards and implementing streamlined processes. This involved crafting checklists
